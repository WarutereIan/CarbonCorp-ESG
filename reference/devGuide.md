        - Interactive mapping interface: Shows source columns and target CarbonCorp fields. User can review and correct AI suggestions, or manually drag-and-drop to map columns.
        - Data preview table: Shows a sample of the data with applied mappings.
        - Data type detection and validation per column (e.g., numeric, date, text). User can override detected type if necessary.
        - Unit conversion options if applicable (e.g., if data is in MWh but system expects kWh, user is prompted to confirm conversion factor).
    - **Step 4: Validation & Error Handling**
        - System performs validation against Data Quality rules (see 4.2) applicable to the annotated data category.
        - Validation results displayed: Number of errors, warnings. Errors are highlighted directly in the data preview table.
        - Guidance on how to fix common errors (e.g., "Date format incorrect in row X, expected YYYY-MM-DD", "Value for 'Energy Consumption' in row Y is outside expected range. Please verify.").
        - Option to "Download Error Report" (CSV showing only rows with errors and error messages).
        - Option to "Proceed with Valid Data Only" or "Cancel and Fix File".
    - **Step 5: Confirmation & Import**
        - Summary of import: File name, annotated category, number of rows to be imported, number of errors (if proceeding with partial import).

        -   Clear labels, input guidance, and tooltips for each field, referencing the underlying standard (e.g., GHG Protocol guidance for specific data points).
        -   Dropdowns for predefined lists (e.g., fuel types, emission factor sources) to ensure consistency.
    -   **Built-in Calculation Engine (especially for GHG Protocol)**:
        -   For calculation-heavy templates (like GHG emissions), the platform performs calculations automatically in real-time or upon submission based on entered activity data.
        -   Utilizes an up-to-date, managed library of emission factors (e.g., from IPCC, EPA, DEFRA). Admins can view and manage preferred emission factor sets in settings.
        -   Calculations are transparent: users can see the emission factors applied and the formulas used (in a simplified view or info pop-up).
        -   Handles different GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O) and calculates CO2-equivalents (CO2e) using appropriate Global Warming Potentials (GWPs).
    -   **Data Validation & Quality Checks (Real-time)**:
        -   As data is entered, validation rules (similar to those in Data Quality Management) are applied (e.g., range checks for activity data, format checks).
        -   Immediate feedback on errors or potential inconsistencies.
    -   **Data Annotation & Contextualization**: 
        -   Similar to Excel uploads, users will specify:

### 6.2. AI Drafting & Content Generation
- **Process**: After initiation, the AI engine (leveraging a GPT-like API) drafts the report content based on the selected template, parameters, design choices, and any custom prompts. This phase is heavily influenced by the chosen initiation method and parameters.
- **Key Enhancements**:
    - **Style-Aware Generation**:
        - AI adheres to the visual theme (fonts, colors, basic layout rules) selected in the Visual Design Studio from the outset.
        - Auto-generates design-matched infographics, charts (using selected chart styles/colors), and tables (formatted according to theme) by providing structured data and style instructions to the GPT API.
    - **Parameter-Driven Content Generation**:
        - AI systematically addresses each selected parameter (topic, metric, disclosure requirement).
        - It fetches relevant data from Data Hub, analyzes it (or uses pre-analyzed insights), and instructs the GPT API to generate narrative, charts (descriptions for charting libraries), and tables.
        - Example: If CSRD ESRS E1-6 "Energy Consumption & Mix" is selected, platform AI pulls energy data, calculates mix percentages, then crafts a detailed prompt for the GPT API to generate descriptive text and specifies the data for a relevant chart.
    - **Contextual Narrative Flow**: The platform AI structures the report and prompts the GPT API section by section to create logical transitions and ensure a coherent storyline, even when combining various parameterized inputs.
    - **Placeholder Generation**: If data for a selected metric/disclosure is missing or incomplete, the platform AI can instruct the GPT API to generate placeholder text like: "[Data for Metric XYZ not yet available. Please connect relevant data source or input manually. This section should describe trends in XYZ...]" or suggest how to collect it.
    - **Dynamic Style Preview during Generation**:
        - The main editor displays content as it's being generated by the GPT API, with the applied styling (rendered by the platform based on GPT output and selected themes).
        - Progress indicators for different sections.
        - Accessibility hints (e.g., color contrast checks for generated charts) can be shown.

### 6.3. AI-Powered Report Editor & Review Interface
- **Implementation**: Main editing and review interface at `/reporting/[reportId]/edit`. The primary focus is on AI-generated content, with user interactions centered on review, feedback for regeneration, and minor adjustments rather than extensive manual content creation.
- **Core Principle**: The AI (GPT-like API, orchestrated by the platform) handles the heavy lifting of content and visual generation. The user guides, reviews, and refines.
- **Components**:
    - **Main Content Viewing Area**: Displays the AI-generated report content section by section. Content is rendered according to the selected Visual Design Studio styles.
        - Text sections are generated by the GPT API.
        - Charts and tables are specified by platform AI (data, type, basic structure) and then rendered by the platform, with styling from the Visual Design Studio. The GPT API might generate titles, captions, or summaries for these.
    - **AI Interaction & Refinement Toolbar/Panel (Contextual per section/element)**:
        - **"Regenerate Section" Button**: Allows users to request the AI to regenerate the current section.
            - Option to provide brief additional feedback/prompts for the regeneration (e.g., "Make this section more concise," "Focus more on X aspect," "Use a more formal tone"). This feedback refines the prompt sent to the GPT API by the platform.
        - **"Minor Adjustments" Tool**: For small textual edits (e.g., correcting a number, rephrasing a single sentence). This is not a full WYSIWYG editor for large-scale changes.
            - Clicking on a text block might allow simple text input for minor changes. Changes are logged.
        - **"Suggest Alternative" (for charts/tables)**: If a chart or table is generated, user can request AI to suggest alternative ways to visualize or present that data.
        - **"Accept Section" / "Mark as Reviewed"**: Allows users to mark sections as reviewed and accepted.
    - **Visual Design & Style Controls (Simplified access to Visual Design Studio elements)**:
        - Quick toggles for minor style adjustments if needed (e.g., change font size for a paragraph if AI didn't get it quite right, adjust chart colors slightly). These should be exceptions, as the primary styling is template-driven.
    - **Data Linkage Inspector**: For AI-generated claims or data points, users can click to see the underlying data from Data Hub or Analytics Hub that was used by the AI to generate that content. This provides traceability.
    - **Reusable Content Blocks Panel (AI-Integrated)**:
        - Users can select pre-defined (or company-saved) structural blocks (e.g., Executive Summary, Methodology, Standard Policy Statement).
        - When a block is inserted, the user can prompt the AI (via platform orchestration of GPT API) to populate or customize that block based on the report's context and available data (e.g., "Populate the Executive Summary block based on the generated report sections").
    - **AI Assistant Panel (Integrated)**:
        - General queries about the report, suggestions for improvement, or requests to add specific information.
        - Example: "AI, can you ensure we have adequately covered the TCFD recommendations for strategy?"
        - "AI, suggest a concluding paragraph for this section on water management."
    - **Design Consistency & Compliance Nudges (AI Powered)**:
        - AI flags if a minor manual adjustment significantly deviates from the Brand Kit or Visual Theme.
        - Alerts for accessibility issues arising from minor adjustments.
    - **Parameter Override/Refinement Panel**: As described in 6.1.2, allowing users to adjust scope, which would then trigger AI-regeneration of affected sections.
    - **Navigation Pane**: Outline view of report sections, click to navigate. Shows review status per section.
